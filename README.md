1. In the Recipe project development pipeline, I should fit my automated tests within Github action that runs whenever code is pushed.<br>
2. No.<br>
3. I would use a unit test to test the “message” feature becuase it can ensure that all code meets quality standards prior to deployment such that the "messsage" should be in a standard format, when it is, it can be sent, otherwise it cannot be sent .<br>
4. I would use a unit test to test the “message” feature of a messaging application becuase it can easily check if the "message" in a range of the required length. If it qualified the requirments, the result would be true, so the message can be sent, otherwise, it will return false.
